          <p>If you have a large home then you must also facilitate easy interactions. Place your seating arrangements in circular or cubicle patterns. You can use ‘L’, ‘C’, or ‘U’ shaped couches rather than individual or sectional sofa sets. Place a large coffee table in the center and some side tables in optimum positions.
            You can also use ottomans or cushions for comfort when you have ample space in your rustic or modern living room.

          <h2>Dining Room Ideas and Designer-Approved Decorating Tips: </h2>
          <h2> Plan the sitting area to facilitate conversation: </h2>
          <p>Your dining room is one of the most special spaces in your home to make memories with the people you love. It's a luxurious alternative to your cozy breakfast nook, kitchen island, or takeout on the couch. As comfortable as you may be eating off a plate with your favorite movie playing in the background, some meals deserve to be elevated and appreciated in style.Be There and Be Square

            Rather than have all of your dinner guests spread out across the dining room sat along a large, rectangular table, opt to bring them (literally) closer together with a square table. This version, designed by BHDM Design, still sits eight, but now everyone is equidistant. And no one is left on the end away from the bustling conversation.</p>

          <h2> Your master bedroom will need to accommodate more than just your bed: </h2>
          <p>Choose Your Bed Wisely
            Remember, your master bedroom will need to accommodate more than just your bed. There needs to be enough space for any additional furniture, like dressers or side tables – as well as enough empty space so the room does not feel crowded. Thus, our number one master bedroom decor idea is that you choose your bed wisely!. That’s right. You have one shot at this (unless you plan on repainting!). Regardless of the occupants, a bedroom is a personal sanctuary for rest and relaxation after a hard day’s work. The color that you put on the walls will set the tone for what you will feel when you are in the room – so it is important that you choose colors that will invigorate you in the morning and soothe your nerves at night.</p>
